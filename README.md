# [NodeJs API for a .NET developer](https://code.waters.com/bitbucket/users/rovian/repos/nodejs-api-for-a-.net-developer)



## About this repo

The purpose of this repo is to provide a "crash course" style intro to Node framework and its capabilities and some good practices.
It is not (and should not be) considered a full course, for that please take the time and go through some online courses. Also, it does not explain everything, it is just enough to get anyone started fast.

There are a few working folders included, you can just run them as they are, however I strongly encourage you to recreate everything from scratch on your machine as you go through the instructions, this will help you understand better the progression.

The tutorials are easy to follow and yield immediate results, so have fun building Node.js apps!



## Prep env

- install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (use LTS)
- verify it works correctly `node -v`
